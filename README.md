# MASM-Calculator

A Calculator written in MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler). It’s a tool used to write programs in assembly language for Intel x86 and x64 processors.

MASM is a low-level programming tool that lets you write instructions very close to what the computer actually understands (machine code). It’s mostly used when you need very fast, efficient, or hardware-specific programming.
